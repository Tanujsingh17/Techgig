Tools and frameworks that can help developers and the tech community to design and develop green code:

1. Carbon Calculators: These tools can help measure the carbon footprint of software development, providing actionable insights on reducing carbon emissions. The device can assess energy consumption, carbon emissions, and other environmental impacts of the software development life cycle (SDLC). 

Example of a carbon calculator in Python that calculates the carbon footprint of software development:

# Import required libraries
import pandas as pd

# Define constants
ELECTRICITY_GRID_EMISSIONS_FACTOR = 0.527 # kgCO2e/kWh
AVERAGE_DESKTOP_POWER_CONSUMPTION = 0.1 # kW
AVERAGE_LAPTOP_POWER_CONSUMPTION = 0.05 # kW
AVERAGE_SERVER_POWER_CONSUMPTION = 0.5 # kW
AVERAGE_MOBILE_DEVICE_POWER_CONSUMPTION = 0.02 # kW

# Define a function to calculate the carbon footprint of software development
def calculate_carbon_footprint(num_desktops, num_laptops, num_servers, num_mobile_devices, hours_per_day, days_per_week, weeks_per_year):
    # Calculate the total energy consumption of the software development
    total_energy_consumption = (num_desktops * AVERAGE_DESKTOP_POWER_CONSUMPTION +
                                num_laptops * AVERAGE_LAPTOP_POWER_CONSUMPTION +
                                num_servers * AVERAGE_SERVER_POWER_CONSUMPTION +
                                num_mobile_devices * AVERAGE_MOBILE_DEVICE_POWER_CONSUMPTION) * hours_per_day * days_per_week * weeks_per_year

    # Calculate the total carbon emissions of the software development
    total_carbon_emissions = total_energy_consumption * ELECTRICITY_GRID_EMISSIONS_FACTOR

    # Return the carbon footprint in kgCO2e
    return total_carbon_emissions

# Example usage
num_desktops = 5
num_laptops = 10
num_servers = 2
num_mobile_devices = 20
hours_per_day = 8
days_per_week = 5
weeks_per_year = 50

carbon_footprint = calculate_carbon_footprint(num_desktops, num_laptops, num_servers, num_mobile_devices, hours_per_day, days_per_week, weeks_per_year)

print(f"The carbon footprint of software development is {carbon_footprint} kgCO2e.")

This code defines a function calculate_carbon_footprint that takes in the number of desktops, laptops, servers, and mobile devices used in software development, as well as the hours per day, days per week, and weeks per year that they are used. It then calculates the software development's total energy consumption and carbon emissions using the constants defined at the top of the code. Finally, it returns the carbon footprint in kgCO2e.

The function is called with some example values in the example usage at the bottom of the code, and the resulting carbon footprint is printed to the console. You can modify the values to match the specifics of your software development process.

2. Sustainable Development Framework: This framework can provide guidelines and best practices for sustainable software development. It can cover various aspects of the SDLC, such as design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance, and provide actionable recommendations on reducing the carbon footprint.

A sustainable development framework typically covers various aspects of the SDLC, including design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Example of a sustainable development framework in Python that provides some guidelines and best practices for each stage:

# Design
# - Consider the environmental impact of the software during the design phase
# - Use energy-efficient algorithms and data structures
# - Optimize the code to reduce energy consumption
# - Use cloud computing and virtualisation to reduce hardware usage

# Development
# - Use energy-efficient programming languages and frameworks
# - Minimize code complexity to reduce energy consumption
# - Use automated testing to reduce energy consumption during manual testing
# - Use continuous integration and deployment to reduce energy consumption during deployment

# Testing
# - Use automated testing to reduce energy consumption during manual testing
# - Test the software in a virtualized environment to reduce hardware usage
# - Use accurate data to simulate real-world usage and reduce energy consumption

# Deployment
# - Use cloud computing and virtualisation to reduce hardware usage
# - Optimize the software configuration to reduce energy consumption
# - Use efficient deployment tools to reduce energy consumption during deployment
# - Monitor the energy consumption of the deployed software and optimise it as necessary

# Maintenance
# - Monitor the energy consumption of the software and optimise it as necessary
# - Use automated monitoring and alerting to reduce energy consumption during manual monitoring
# - Use energy-efficient practices when updating and upgrading the software

This code provides some general guidelines and best practices for each stage of the SDLC. These are just examples, and specific rules may vary depending on the nature of the software being developed. Nonetheless, following these guidelines can help reduce the carbon footprint of software development and make it more sustainable.

Of course, this code is not a complete framework, but it can be a starting point for developing a more comprehensive sustainable development framework.
